# Portfolio-Project-US-Medical-Insurance-Data
A more-or-less UNguided Codecademy project that culminates the Data Science Foundation I coursework.

This project is right at the end of Codecademy's Data Science Fundamentals I course. It's after learners have practiced Python lists, loops, functions, dictionaries, and file methods; but before they are exposed to the scipy, numpy, and pandas libraries.
